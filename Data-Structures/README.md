> "Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." — Linus Torvalds

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates my understanding and implementation of fundamental data structures in Python. Each implementation is designed with clean code practices, proper documentation, and efficient algorithms to showcase both theoretical knowledge and practical coding skills.

## 📋 Implemented Data Structures

### Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List** (`LinkedList.py`)
  - A linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations
  - Implementation includes: initialization, append, display, and length methods
  - Time complexity analysis included in code comments
  
- **Doubly Linked List** (`DoubleLinkedList.py`)
  - An extension of the singly linked list with bidirectional traversal capabilities
  - Optimized implementation with methods for insertion at beginning/end and deletion from beginning/end
  - Error handling for edge cases (empty lists, single-node operations)

## 🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Class design with proper encapsulation
  - Inheritance and method implementation
  
- **Algorithm Efficiency**
  - Time complexity considerations for all operations
  - Memory-efficient implementations
  
- **Error Handling**
  - Graceful handling of edge cases
  - Informative error messages

## 💡 Practical Applications

| Data Structure | Real-World Applications |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Singly Linked List | Implementation of stacks, hash tables, adjacency lists for graphs |
| Doubly Linked List | Browser cache (forward/back navigation), MRU/LRU caches, undo functionality in applications |

## 🔍 Code Examples

### Creating and Using a Singly Linked List

```python
# Initialize a new linked list
my_list = linked_list()

# Add elements
my_list.append("Interview")
my_list.append("Ready")
my_list.append("Developer")

# Display the list
my_list.display()  # Output: ['Interview', 'Ready', 'Developer']
```

### Creating and Using a Doubly Linked List

```python
# Initialize a doubly linked list
dll = doublyLinkedList()

# Add elements
dll.InsertToEmptyList("Data")
dll.InsertToEnd("Structures")
dll.InsertToEnd("Expert")

# Display all elements
dll.Display()
```

## 🛠️ Testing

Each data structure implementation includes simple test cases to demonstrate functionality. Unit tests with proper assertions will be added in future updates.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Implementation of more complex data structures:
  - Binary Search Trees
  - AVL Trees
  - Hash Tables
  - Heaps
  - Graphs
  
- Addition of comprehensive unit tests
- Time complexity visualization tools
- Interactive examples
